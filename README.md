# Notes App

This project is a **Notes App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to create, view, and manage notes directly in the browser. It utilizes **Local Storage** to save the notes, ensuring that they are preserved even after closing or restarting the browser.

## Features

- **Create and Manage Notes**: Users can easily create new notes and manage existing ones.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are stored using **Local Storage**, allowing them to persist between browser sessions.
- **No Backend Required**: Since the app uses Local Storage, no backend server or database is needed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the notes app interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For adding notes functionality, handling Local Storage, and managing user interactions.

## Local Storage

The app uses the browser's Local Storage to save notes. This means that your notes will remain available even after closing and reopening the browser. However, they are specific to the browser and device you are using.

## Setup

No additional setup is required. Simply open the index.html file in your browser to use the app.
